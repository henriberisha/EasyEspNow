### Credits & Disclaimer

I want to give great credits to the main source from which i got the inspiration to work on this library and on which i based a lot of the logic and concepts used in the code. This source is the repository: [gmag11/QuickESPNow](https://github.com/gmag11/QuickESPNow) with Germán Martín as a maintainer. I included the MIT license with the original copyright. In addition i appended another copyright that would cover any functionalities that I added.  
When i started working on `EasyEspNow` source code, I initially wanted to learn more about this protocol called `ESP-NOW` and was coding different sketches using the low level API that ESP-NOW has. In addition, i wanted to keep my coding skills sharp and practice more on C/C++. As the work continued, it turned into the shape of a library which aimed to facilitate the use and implementation of `ESP-NOW`. Finally i decided to publish it as an open source library with the goal to help other fellow programmers.  
if you are looking for a more mature library i would strongly advise you to look into [gmag11/QuickESPNow](https://github.com/gmag11/QuickESPNow). It also has around 95 ⭐ as per this time.
